# Mindful Music

With recommendations taking over our Music listening habits, we have found ourselves ever more disconnected from Music. We are in an never-ending quest to find good music, but the instant gratification the recommendations provide, has made it difficult to dedicate as much attention to Music as it demands. Music as such, has become a victim to the 'Attention Economy'.

Through this project, I attempt to redirect more of our attention to Music. The Music cards are made to bring our attention back to the albums we like, and through repeated listening, develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of Music.
